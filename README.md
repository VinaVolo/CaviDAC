<h2>üíª Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   To launch the application enter the following command in the console:
      ```
      python CalixVolApp/GUI/app.py
      ```
*   There are 4 folders in the CalixVolApp directory:
      1) calculation - there are files for calculation and visualization
      2) data - here the coordinates of molecules (molecules) are stored, as well as vdw radii (vdw)
      3) GUI - it stores the file with the application (app.py)
      4) utils - files for working with paths
